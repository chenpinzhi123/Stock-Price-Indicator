# Stock-Price-Indicator
Build and train machine learning / deep learning models and try to forecast stock returns / movements.

## Project Description:

•	Use machine learning / deep learning models to build the stock returns against a list of explanatory variables, each of them properly normalized.

•	Analyze the stock price (return) predictability among the provided factors.

•	Deploy the model, such that users can get the prediction of price movements tomorrow.

## Data

I use the following three datasets to retrieve data and perform analysis:

•	[Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/): Web API are used to get the stock prices.

•	[FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/): Web API are used to get the economic data. For example, interest rates, dollar index, etc.

•	[Professor Kenneth R. French's Website](http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/): Fama-French factor models used Fama-French factors. The up-to-date factors are freely available in the website.
